# Jumping into C++

This repository contains my solution to all the problems in the book Jumping into C++. I started coding around 2024 and this is my first time writing C++. All Solutions are done by myself and some help of different AI assistans (CS50AI(cs50.ai/chat)/ChatGPT GPT Extension Code Tutor/Mistral coding AI codestral). Feel free to dm me if u rconfused about anything the Problem Sets are not easy at all. 

Midway through the chapters ( around chapter 15 ) i tried switching to the tigerbeetles tiger style of coding look it up if u want to learn about writing safe and high performing code!
